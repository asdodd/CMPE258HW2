Assume you receive real-estate data for 10 million samples as input and each sample has 25 different features/attributes. Design a 3 layers fully connected network to predict the value of a house for sale (test section).  Assign 90 to 10 ratio for splitting train and test sets. Include at least one sort of regularization and apply 1000 iterations for your training step. Besides these, as a designer, feel free to set the rest of your network hyperparameters as you wish.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"wmtED-_phVjV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637882457971,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":232,"user":{"displayName":"Alex Dodd","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13647900955559340802"}}},"source":["import tensorflow as tf\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import BatchNormalization\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Conv2D\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import MaxPooling2D\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Activation\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Flatten\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dropout\n","from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\n","\n","from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical\n","\n","from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","\n","import numpy as np"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"JTzrXELJjTHE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1637882459487,"user_tz":480,"elapsed":215,"user":{"displayName":"Alex Dodd","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/default-user=s64","userId":"13647900955559340802"}}},"source":["def build(classes=2):\n","  model = Sequential()\n","\n","  #
